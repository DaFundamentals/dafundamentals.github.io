With a completely open architecture and code base, you can modify the code to make it do exactly what you want, without having to jump through all kinds of confusing or proprietary code.

If there's a feature you need but it isn't available here, let me know and I might add it. Alternatively, if you fork the theme, I would love to see your modifications and enhancements.
